# 🏠 HomeTag

HomeTag is a **multi-user web application** designed to help people organize and remember item locations within their homes by tagging them directly on uploaded blueprints or floor plans.

The project solves a common everyday problem: *forgetting where items are stored*. HomeTag provides a visual and intuitive way to mark, store, and revisit item locations over time.
